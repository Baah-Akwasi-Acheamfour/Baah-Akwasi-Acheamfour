## 👨‍💻 About Me

<p>
I’m currently an IT student at <strong>University of Ghana, Legon</strong>, and a dedicated learner in the <strong>ALX Software Engineering Frontend Program</strong>.
<br><br>
My journey into software engineering began with a curiosity for how tech shapes our world — and has grown into a deep passion for building web experiences that are beautiful, accessible, and impactful.
</p>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: `responsive frontend projects` and `personal portfolio site`
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: `React`, `Responsive Design`, `API Integration`
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: `open-source`, `frontend mentoring`, `real-world web apps`
- 💬 Ask me about: `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `ALX`, or `frontend projects`
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe the smallest design decisions can have the biggest impact on user experience
